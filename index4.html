This paragraph has an image that is floated to the right.<div class="floating"><p><img src="1234.jpeg" /></div> It s highly recommended to add a margin to images so that the text does not get too close to the image.<br /><br />
If you want your text to be easily read, you should always add a few pixels between words and borders, words and borders, images, and other content<br /><br /></p>
